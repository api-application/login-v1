About the Project:
I created this website with  html, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, mysql and Bootstrap templates.

The Packages I used for this website<br />
[express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
<br />
[path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path)<br />
[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)<br />
[jsonwebtoken](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)<br />
[cookie-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser)<br />
[express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)<br />
[body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)<br />
 [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)<br />


After you install all packages above.<br />
npm install (Package name)<br />
you can run  nodemon app.js<br />

Localhost: 3000<br />
<br />
What is website for:<br />
Website just simple design for sign and login page with node.js and mysql database 

Isetup MySQL datebase on PHPmyAdmin ,XAMPP<br />

Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.<br />
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).<br />

- #### Other Operating Systems<br />
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).<br />
If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.<br />
    $ node --version    v8.11.3<br />
    $ npm --version    6.1.0<br />
If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.<br />
    $ npm install npm -g
