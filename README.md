Localhost: 3000

What is website for:
Website just simple design for sign and login page with node.js and mysql database 

Isetup MySQL datebase on PHPmyAdmin ,XAMPP

Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).
If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.
    $ node --version    v8.11.3
    $ npm --version    6.1.0
If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.
    $ npm install npm -g
